    "    Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "    Classically controlled robots have revolutionised assembly lines where the environment is restricted and predictable. However, this control scheme has proven less effective in uncertain, unstructured environments due to the unmodelled nonlinearities in the morphology and its interaction with the environment. Embodied intelligence suggests that we are not controlled centrally but rather that the morphology and environment also contribute to behaviour. Therefore, the passive dynamics of the robot could be exploited to simplify the controller by making the passive dynamics closer to the desired behaviour. Consequently, there has been a growing interest in soft robots which have many passive degrees of freedom and are often underactuated. However, classical control necessitates exact kinematic and dynamic models which are hard to derive analytically for soft robots due to the nonlinear dynamics of the body, external forces and uncertain, unstructured environment. Model-free approaches are a potential solution to these problems as they can approximate inverse kinematic and dynamic models that accounts for the unknown nonlinearities.\n",

    "    Control Learning for Locomotion\n",
    "\n",
    "    Control for locomotion of soft robots can also be learned. Vibration-driven tensegrity robots present a challenge as the motion is unpredictable and therefore have no known analytical solution for generating gait.\n",
    "    X used an evolutionary algorithm to optimise the motor frequencies for the control of a physical vibration-driven tensegrity robot and exploited the inherent resonance of the tensegrity structures to increase the locomotion speed. Y also aimed to exploit the resonance of a vibration-driven tensegrity robot to increase locomotion speed. However, they used Bayesian optimisation to efficiently learn control for a physical robot. The policy is learned by optimising three pulse width modulation values that control the input voltage of the vibrating motors. Bayesian optimisation models the objective function using regression and uses this to select the next point to acquire. Comparing the results between random search and Bayesian optimisation with and without a prior, they found the Bayesian optimisation with a prior produced the fastest speed using the same number of trials.\n",
